# Virtual-FileSystem

This here is a virtual file system. I have:
•	Coded a library that simulates virtual file operations on a virtual disk, using three binary files to mimic a storage device. 
•	Converted all files into binary to store in the binary file storages.
•	Implemented a Merkle hash tree, to store all the data in a hash data file
•	Implemented a memory compressor, to provide more readily available memory space after a file has been removed or edited.
•	Composed and ran unit tests, and integration tests to run and test each function to ensure they work individually and with each other


You can run the pogram by writing in the runtestfile, by creating another function and testing it out.
